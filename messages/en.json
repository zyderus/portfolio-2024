My path into tech was not the typical one. I started out just trying to make a web page with a guestbook (it was ugly, but it worked). Then life pulled me into wild detours: consulting, managing artists, recruiting, logistics. All of it taught me how people think, what they need, and how broken most software really is. |\n\nEventually, I got pulled back in â€” this time through C++ and Arduino â€” and I havenâ€™t looked back. Now, I bring all that real-world grit into every product I build. Whether itâ€™s frontend, backend, or wired up to hardware, I love solving real problems with simple, powerful solutions.","experience":{"101":"EPAM Systems | Software Engineer | Vilnius, Lithuania | Collaborated with a team to enhance ERP integration for a European e-commerce platform.
