          "description": "I'm Rustam, and I have a passion for crafting user-friendly applications. My journey into application development began in 1998 when, as a student, I delved into HTML and CGI scripting to create my first personal web page complete with a guestbook. While it was somewhat functional, its design left much to be desired. Despite this early foray into coding, over the next few years my career steered me away to business consulting, artist management, construction recruiting, and logistics.\n\nIn 2018, everything changed when I encountered Arduino and its implementation of C++. This sparked something within, reigniting my fascination with programming. Since then, I've been dedicated to creating intuitive and engaging apps that enrich the user experience.",
